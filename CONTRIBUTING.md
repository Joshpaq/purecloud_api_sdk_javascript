## Building the Documentation

1. Execute ````jsdoc src -r -a all -d jsdoc```` to generate the JSDoc documentation and put it in the _jsdoc_ folder.
2. Copy the output from the _jsdoc_ folder to the root of the ````gh-pages```` branch. This will publish the documentation to the github pages site.

## Building the Library

1. Execute ````gulp````
2. Use ````pure-cloud-api.js```` from the _dist_ folder
